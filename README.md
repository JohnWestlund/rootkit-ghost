Using your favorite editor, and edit the `default.hbs` file, find

```javascript
  var setting = {
    baseurl:    'http://xensoft.com',
    disqus:     'xensoft',
    ga:         'UA-43244208-1',
    gas_client: 'ca-pub-0333905063777933',
    gas_slot:   '8822000487',
    ad_id:      'header'
  };
```

and set the properties:
- `baseurl` The base url of your site, used to help disqus keep track of which comments belong to which page.
- `disques`  your disqus short name.
- `ga` your google analytics tracking code.
- `gas_client` your google adsense client code.
- `gas_slot` your google adsense ad slot code.
- `ad_id` where on your side you would like the ads to appear, by default its appened to tags with the `id='header'`

After saving the file, you need to restart the ghost server, to make the changes work. And then you're all done!

A stylish theme for [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) blogs.

Features
--------

* **Two color schemes** — One for _rootkit Dark_ and one for _rootkit Light_. Just swap the reference to the `colors-dark.css` file with `colors-light.css` if you don't like light-on-dark.
* **Responsive Design** — rootkit adapts to fit any screen size.


Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository and upload the `rootkit` directory to your Ghost blog's `content/themes` folder.

2. Restart Ghost.

3. Go to the Settings page of the Ghost backend and select `rootkit` from the Theme dropdown.


Customization
-------------

Rootkit supports Ghost's logo and cover image features, and will work perfectly fine with or without them. If you wish to upload a cover image, it will appear above the rest of the page. An uploaded logo replaces the textual blog name. (If you later decide you don't want a logo or cover image, you can remove it by clicking on the appropriate option in Settings and selecting the trash can icon.)


Syntax Higlighting
------------------

Rootkit uses [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting, which works in tandem with fenced Markdown code blocks like so:

	```language-javascript
	var t = new Thing("Test!");
	```

Valid language classes include `language-markup`, `language-css`, `language-javascript`, `language-ruby`, and `language-php`. Prism.js supports a large range of additional languages (most of which have been included in Solar), as well as generic support for C-like languages.

To-Do
-----

* The included modified 'Munro' font needs a major overhaul
    * Make monospaced?
    * Negative space inside letters doesn't show up on all OS/Browser combos
